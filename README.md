# TLC Elixir
A web app to experiment with and validate the RSMP draft specification for traffic light controller fixed-time programs, see:
See https://github.com/rsmp-nordic/tlc_programming for more on the specification.

The app shows a traffic light simulator where you can run and edit traffic light programs.

The app is written in Elixir using the Phoenix framework.

## Prerequisites
You need Elixir on your machine, see: https://elixir-lang.org/

## Running
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
